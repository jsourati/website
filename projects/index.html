My projects could be divided into two distinct groups: (1) developing generic Active Learning (AL) methods and applying them on various applications including medical image processing, and (2) applying machine learning and network models to analyze social aspects of scientific knowledge production.</p>

<h3><b> Active Learning </b></h3>
<p>Active learning (AL) is a branch of machine learning that addresses the problem of minimizing the cost of data annotations necessary for training accurate learning models. This task is increasingly paid more attention in the era of data science where raw, unannotated data are available in low cost but their labeling is time-consuming and financially expensive. Classically, AL methods assumed a fixed budget for labeling samples, and formulated the problem as how to select a certain number of queries such that their annotations will likely provide the most amount of information towards the best model fit.</p>

<p><a name="GAL"></a></p>
<h4><b> Generic AL </b></h4>
<p>A major part of my research included addressing two shortcomings of the most popular querying metric in AL, that is entropy-basede Unertainty Sampling (US). This metric selects those queries about which the model has the highest uncertainty. While US has a sound mathematical optimization problem, in practice it often leads to selecting redundant queries and/or outliers. These types of queries are not desirable in AL settings since they do not provide maximum information gain. The main source of sub-optimality in entropy-based US goes back to considering individual labeling candidates separately in the querying optimization.</p>

     The issue of redundancy (image is taken from  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-012-0507-8">Fu et al. 2013</a>)
</div>

<p>Numerous hueristics have been suggested to fix these issues of US. We proposed to change the querying objective to a more sophisticated information theoretical metric, i.e., Mutual Information (MI) and Fisher Information (FI). Both MI and FI by definition have mechansims that enable them to automatically address above issues: MI measures expected information gain of all the candidate queries and their (unknown) annotations collectively in its formulation, and FI aims at choosing samples that are most informative regarding the joint distribution of the whole data.</p>

<p>Our MI- and FI-based algorithms were first of their own kind. Our MI framework attacked the querying problem via directly computing MI between discrete class labels of the query candidates despite all the previous attempts that worked with crude approximations. On FI’s side, we theoretically explained how FI-based active learning can improve the information gain when being used in conjunction with maximul-likeliood estimators. Our derivations have been published in the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) (<a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-104/15-104.pdf" class="external">see here</a>), where we reviewed other similar methods and demonstrated their theoretical drawbacks with regards to ours.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top </a></p>

<p><a name="AppAL"></a></p>
<h4><b>  Application to Medical Image Processing </b></h4>
<p>Our proposed information theoretical AL methods explained above dramatically outperformed entropy-based US and random sampling baselines on popular machine learning benchmarks (e.g., <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php" class="external">UCI datasets</a>). Testing them on a real-world application was whta I did in my first postdoc at Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>In hospitals gigantic amount of unlabeled images are being produced on a daily basis and there is a need for AI-assisted algorithms to increase the speed and accuracy of their interpretation. There are several impediments in doing this task. Here’s a brief list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The pre-trained state-of-the-art deep learning models cannot be readily applied to all groups of patients due to large visual characteristics of their medical images.</li>
  <li>Training or fine-tuning deep models is not possible for many patient groups as enough annotated data is not available for all ages or pathological conditions.</li>
  <li>Preparing annotations for medical images is a time-consuming and costly task and in most cases only a small number of image volumes can be labeled due to budget considerations.</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues sound like a good application of AL to train or fine-tune a deep model with a fixed labeling budget. We slightly modified our FI-based AL to make it tractable for deep models and applied it with Convolutional Nneural Networks (CNN) on the problem of IntraCranial Cavity (ICC) extraction in brain MRI images. We worked with three distinct patient groups: healthy adolescents, newborns (with age between two months and 2.5 years) and patients with <a href="https://www.tsalliance.org/about-tsc/what-is-tsc/" class="external">Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)</a>}. Visual characteristics of these images, specifically T1- and T2-weighted MR images, vary extensively among these groups. For example, we noticed that T1-MRI images of newborns show a completely reversed intensity contrast compared to older subjects.</p>

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

<p>Because of major variabilities across the images, models trained on one group will not be accurately generalized to the rest. We pre-trained a CNN based on healthy adolescents and used our modified FI-based AL to fine-tune it to the other two groups with limited number of annotations. Comparing the results with multiple variations of US that were common in medical image processing indicated that using FI enabled the model to reach a high performance with significantly smaller number of annotaions. In the setting explained above, this means that using FI queyring metric lead to a more generalizable model with a fixed labeling budget.</p>

<h4><b> Interactive Unsupervised Learning </b></h4>
<p>All I explained so far was the development and application of AL in supervised learning problems. I also worked with similar issues in the context of unsupervised learning. Indeed, this line of research formed the very first project that I did in my Ph.D.. Since AL comes to the scene when some kinds of interaction exists between the machine and the user, we considered constrained clustering algorithm where the user-provided <em>pairwise</em> constraints were in form of must- and cannot-links.</p>

<p>The idea of entropy-based US can also be applied in this problem, but with the same redundancy and outlier vulnaribility issues. In my project, we addressed the latter issue by combining entropy and an estimate of data density to make sure that the queries are located in dense regions. We applied our density-weighted AL algorithm with an extended version of spectral clustering that could be scaled to segment intermediate size to large images. The final product was a practical user-interactive unsupervised framework that could segment complicated images by only using naive intensity features and with the help of AL-accelerated user pairwise constraints.</p>

<h3><b> Social Analysis of Scientific Knowledge Discoveries </b></h3>
<p>My personal interests on social science topics and humanities drove me to start a second post-doc at Knowledge Lab in the Sociology Department of University of Chicago. In there, supervised by prominent computational sociologist James A. Evans, I becamse familiar with the topic of Science of Science and started a project about social aspects of scientific knowledge discoveries.</p>

<p>We investigated the importance of incorporating authors and their interconnections in the analysis of scientific findings. The intuition behind our work was that scientists are the main workforce of science’s engine and it is required to take into account their roles when analyzing advancement of scinece. Our numerical results supported this intuition and confirmed a huge improving effect when considering social aspects of science as well as its contents.</p>

<p>Our findings in this direction will be reported in a paper that is in prepartion at this time. More materials will be uploaded soon. Please bear with us.</p>
